### /reactivity üîÅ

> In short, reactivity means, the result of a computation, which has dependencies, will be **automatically updated** when the **dependencies change**.

**You**: BUT WAIT? These solutions are for browsers only right? and your talk says **EVERYWHERE**!! üò†

### /reactivity/solution/everywhere

Vue 3 is ~~just around the corner~~ finally here and sports a function-based API approach which exposes some powerful functionalities.

What does that mean?

- For the sake of this talk, let's say we get to *steal* its, now standalone, reactivity system and use it **anywhere** we want. It's framework-agnostic! ü§Ø
  - Conventional:
    - in a legacy app with no (proper) reactivity system
    - in other frameworks lol.. why not? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇ
    - in your (insert name here) upcoming epic framework
  - Unconventional:
    - in node applications (e.g CLI, server, etc)

**Me**: *Demo time!* üòé
